Key Points to Remember:

Gates Control Flow: Forget gate removes irrelevant info, input gate adds new info, output gate controls what to output.
Cell State: The "memory" that persists through time with minimal transformations.
Vanishing Gradient Solution: LSTMs solve the vanishing gradient problem through the cell state.
Applications: Time series prediction, language modeling, speech recognition, etc.
